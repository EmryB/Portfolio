        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Website Development</h1>
        <p>Developing a website was a lot less complicated than I thought it would be, but that does
            not mean that it was easy. I had many struggles, especially during the development of my
            GitHub website. It was hard to stay focused when I could not figure something out. As a
            new learner, figuring out how to add things to the online repo was a problem. It was
            difficult to remember all of the steps in the beginning. There were definitely problems
            getting everything to work on GitHub. But most of the problems could be solved fairly
            quickly.</p>
        <p> I think that more creativity can be used on GitHub because you are creating basically
            everything, unlike WordPress, where you pick a theme and the majority of the website is
            already set up for you. WordPress is the easier option, but it allows much less
            customization. Developing the WordPress site did not take nearly as much time as the
            GitHub site did. Because we did the GitHub site first, I was able to copy and paste my
            work into WordPress. You could also just type normally in WordPress, and it would format
            it for you.</p>
        <p>There were many difficulties creating my websites. On GitHub, sizing images to the
            correct proportions took up a lot of time. Getting the picture to align in the correct
            spot was also something that I struggled with. On WordPress, pictures were also a
            difficulty. Because WordPress has a limit on the picture size that you can upload,
            resizing the images was another added step that was not hard, but still added to the
            workload.</p>
        <p>One of the skills you need to develop is persistence because it takes a lot of time and
            trials to get things to fit and work the way you want them. Along with that is
            problem-solving, because it can get very confusing and frustrating, and being able to
            figure out what is causing the problems helps a lot. Learning more about CSS would be
            helpful. I like the styling factor of things on the websites. I find it fun to mess
            around in the CSS, but my knowledge is limited on it because I have not been doing
            website development for very long.</p>
