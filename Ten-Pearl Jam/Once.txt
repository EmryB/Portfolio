I admit it, what's to say? (Yeah)
I'll relive it, without pain


Hm, backstreet lover on the side of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes, I pray


Once upon a time I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah


Oh, try and mimic, what's insane
I am in it, where do I stand?


Hm, Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet, I pray


Once upon a time I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah, oh!







Rah!
You think I got my eyes closed
But I've been lookin' at you the whole fuckin' time


Ooh, once upon a time I could control myself, yeah
Once upon a time I could lose myself, yeah


Once upon a time I could love myself, yeah
Once upon a time I could love you, yeah, yeah
Once! Once! Once! Once! Yeah
Once! Once! Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh once!
