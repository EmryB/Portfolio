Wa!


On the edge, a windowsill
Ponders his maker, ponders his will
To the street below, he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view and he sinks the needle deep, yeah


Oh, can't touch the bottom, in too deep, yeah
Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom


Oh, on the edge of a know-nothing town
Feeling quite superior, the age had come
To the sky above, he just ain't nothin'
But he's got a great view and he sinks the burnin' knife deep, yeah


Woo! Can't touch the bottom, in too deep, yeah
Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom, in too deep


Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh



On the edge of a Christmas-clean love
Young virgin down from heaven visiting hell
To the man above her, she just ain't nothing
And she doesn't like the view, she doesn't like the view
She doesn't like the view, but he sinks himself deep


Oh, can't touch the bottom, in too deep, yeah
Uh-huh, can't touch the bottom, can't touch the bottom, deep, yeah


Oh-oh-oh, the bottom (Hey)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (Hey)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (Yeah, oh)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (Yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh, hey, the bottom (Yeah)
Oh-oh, ah
