Hey-hey-hey
Yeah-ah


Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Her lace spread out before me, as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul, as the Earth to the Sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn


Ooh-oh, and all I taught her was everything
Mmm, oh, I know she gave me all that she wore


And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything


I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I see her?


Mmm-hmm, all the twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinnin', oh, I'm spinnin'
How quick the Sun can drop away



And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything


All the love gone bad, turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be, yeah
Uh-huh
(Uh-huh, ooh)


I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky, but why? Why?
Why can't it be? Oh, can't it be mine?
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
Ooh, ah, yeah
Ah, ooh-ooh


(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Oh, oh-yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ah-ah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ah-ah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ah, yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ah-ah, yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Yeah, ah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
