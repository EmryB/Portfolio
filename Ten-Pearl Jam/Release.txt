(Ah)
Oh, oh
Oh


I see the world, feel the chill
Which way to go, windowsill
I see the words on a rockin' horse of time
I see the birds in the rain, oh


Oh, oh
Oh, oh


Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain, release me


Oh, oh I
Oh, oh


Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
I'll open up, release me
Release me
Release me, ah
Release me


Oh, oh I
Oh, woah-oh-oh
Ah ooh, oo
