Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift, glide me towards you
Know something's left
And we're all allowed to dream of the next


Oh
Oh, of the next time we touch, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


You don't have to stray
Though oceans away, waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise, please stand by the shore


Oh, oh-oh
Oh, I will be, I will be there once more, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
