What the fuck is this world runnin' to? You didn't
Leave a message, at least I coulda learned your voice one last time
Daily minefield, this could be my time by you
Would you hit me? Would you hit me?


Oh oh oh
Oh, ow


All the bills go by and initiatives are taken up
By the middle; there ain't gonna be any middle anymore
And the cross I'm bearin' home ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch, left the porch


Oh oh oh


Hear my name, take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand, walk beside me
I just need to say


(Yeah, ah)
(Yeah, no)
(Oh, ooh)
(Ooh)
(Yeah, yeah)



Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah


Hear my name, take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand, lie beside me
I just need to say


I could not take, oh, just one day
I know that I would not ever
Touch you, hold you, feel you in my arms
Never again
Yeah-hey-hey, yeah-hey-hey
Yeah-hey-hey
Yeah-hey-hey, yeah-hey-hey
Yeah-hey-hey
Yeah-hey-hey, yeah-hey-hey
Yeah-hey-hey
Yeah-hey-hey, yeah-hey-hey
Yeah-hey-hey
