If you could see what I see now
You gotta know I'm looking up, oh, so proud
The one I used to hold is, oh, so special
Mmm, and every setback now but a chance to grow
If further proof that you're phenomenal
You better believe it that you are something special
Woah woah
Afraid to fail, oh, same as afraid to try
These are the days to accept all invites
'Cause you're so cool and, baby, on the level


Oh, and someday you
May find yourself in the place that I now do
And someway you, yeah
You're gonna have to let it go, woah-oh
And I got proof
'Cause my heart, it aches and it breaks but I believe in you
It's the truth


And it's okay, should this life knock you down
The twisted wheel, you know it keeps on spinning 'round
Bet on yourself, your number's, oh, so special
Mmm and when it gets fucked up you need a helping hand
Do it yourself, you're not the type to need a man
But if you find one, he better know you're damn special



Oh and someday you
May find yourself in the place that I now do
And someway you
Gonna have to let it go
And I got proof
For my heart, it aches and breaks, but I believe in you
Woah ain't it, oh, ain't it the truth?


Mmm, remind yourself and find what makes you free
It's goal to goal and time to find out what you seek
And in between, avoid the devil
Oh and if the night grows long, you're not feeling loved
I will be there and not 'cause it's my job
I work for free because you're both so special


Oh ain't it, oh ain't it the truth?
We believe, believe, believe in you
We all got something, we all got something to prove
Oh, out of everyone, you're not just anyone
You're the one and only you
We done all we can do
