(One! Two! One, two, three, four!)
Yeah-yeah-yeah


Got me running, got me running, but the race, it never ends
Got me running, or else I'm done in
You got me coming as you’re going and the chase, it never ends
I'll be running 'til the second coming


Dictator, love hater
Lost in the tunnel and the tunnel ain't no fun
Now I'm lost in all the shit you're flushing
Victrola, controller
Lost in the tunnel and the tunnel's getting funneled
Like the sewage in the plumbing 'cause we left the fucking water running


(Woo)
Yeah-yeah-yeah


Got me diving, got me diving, got me deep, I get the bends
When I'm summoned, or too late coming
You got me running, got me running, but the race, it never ends
I'm feeling done in, it's rather stunning



Dictator, love hater
Lost in the tunnel and the tunnel ain’t no fun
Now I’m lost in all the shit you're flushing
Victrola, controller
Lost in the tunnel and the tunnel’s getting funneled
Like the sewage in the plumbing 'cause we left the fucking water running


Was cleared for, for liftoff
Aborted my take off
Living in the shadows, crossing my fingers
A date with the gallows and a reprieve not looking likely


You got me running, you got me running
You got me running, you got me running
All clear for liftoff, I wanna take off
I got my head up, straight down the tunnel!
You are the tunnel! I wanna see you!
Now watch me walk off, so see you fuck off!
Ah!
