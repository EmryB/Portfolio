You can be loved by everyone
And not feel, not feel love
You can be told by everyone
And not hear a word from above


Swallowed up by the sound cutting holes in the clouds
Finds herself in the song, hears her own voice rising


You can be loved by everyone
And still not feel, not feel love
You can relate, but still can't stop
Or conquer the fear you are what you're not
Would have to take an act of faith
To find relief and escape the blame


Words follow her down, needs to shake 'em off now, oh
This godforsaken town don't deserve her anyhow


Callin' on a messenger
Awaitin' on a face (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
That she could trust, a messenger
For her love, her love



Oh, you can be loved by everyone
And not feel, feel love
You can be told to not give up
And still not hear a word from above
You can't take or give what you got
Dissolve the fear you are what you're not, no
You can be loved by everyone
And not feel, feel love




You can be loved
You, you can be love
You, you can be loved
You, you can be love
You




(Sometimes I feel something, at times I feel there are lies)
Be mighty, be humble, be mighty humble
(Yeah, yeah, oh, listen closer)
