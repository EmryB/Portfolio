Steal the lights from our eyes, drain the blood from our hearts
In all of this dark matter
Take the breath from our chest, break the thoughts in our mind
We're losin' time, dark matter 


Denounce the demigods
King diamond to discard
Deploy the dialogue
Your word against the law


It's strange these days
When everybody else pays for someone else's mistake
This blame takes shape
Still, everybody else pays for someone else's mistake


Erodin' away, we're pullin' apart
In all of this dark matter
I once heard it said, and it stuck in my head
"Arrested the press, no one knows what happened next"


Renounce the demagogues
King diamonds to discard
Deploy the dialogue
Your word against the law


It's strange these days
When everybody else pays for someone else's mistake
This blame takes shape
Still, everybody else pays for someone else's mistake


No tolerance for intolerance or
No patience left for impatience no more
No love lost for lost loves
No sorrow for the unaccountable




Oh
It's strange these days
When everybody else pays for someone else's mistake
This blame takes shape
Still, everybody else pays for someone else's mistake
