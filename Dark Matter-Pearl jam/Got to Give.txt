Stormy seas behind your eyes
The dark moon is setting on your cheap disguise
Whoever said love is a compromise
Knew you


Castle falling, turning into sand
The high tide is crumbling on the rocks we sit
Never could believe a single word they said
About you


And there I am, just picking up the parts
A broken engine busted, lifted up on blocks
Shoulda made the turns when the road got rough
But who knew


I'll be the last one standing
I'll be the first to forgive, yeah
Give it away empty-handed
Breaks in my heart 'til something gives


I saw the doctor, said I'm falling apart
This heartbreak connection, all the blood dried up
Said he could've fixed it, had to open me up
Just like you


And I can't stand it, 'cause it's no way to live
The pain of this every day has got to give
Give me liberty or give me death
Over you


I'll be the last one standing
I'll be the first to forgive, yeah
Give it away empty-handed
Breaks in my heart 'til something gives


Getting to the point where I can't breathe
Getting to the point got nothing to sing
Getting to the point where life don't
Mean a thing, let's get to the point
We all are heard and seen
Oh, let's get to the point, we can
We can believe
That we are better together, you and me, yeah
Can take on anyone, anyone, if you can see


Something's got to give
Got to give
Something's, something's got to give, yeah
Something's got to give, yeah
Something's got to give
Got to give
Huh!
