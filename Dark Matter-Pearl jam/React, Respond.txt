I see you worried and hurried
As if addressing the jury
Oh, you are innocent till proven innocent
You are hurting and it's so magnificent
Don't let the sky hook beat you to submission
Maybe it's the price, the price of our admission
Ain't no fucking roses to our condition
Turn this anger into nuclear fission, yeah, baby, baby


Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Don't react, respond
Don't react, respond
When what you get is what you don't want
Don't react, respond


Are we at war with each other?
Are you at war with yourself?
We could be fighting together
Instead of fighting ourselves
Start the rebuttal
All part of the game
Yes, what makes us different
And what makes us the same
Ah, the incandescence that is your essence
The unexpected embrace, embrace the unexpected
There's no book on this life, there's no use as directed
The best part I know was when we were connected



Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh


Don't react, respond
Don't react, respond
When what you get is what you don't want
Don't react


As the light gets brighter as it grows
The darkness, it recedes
It's better to give, give than to deceive
Questions dissolve the more you believe, ah


Don't react, respond
Don't react, respond
When you get what you don't want
Don't react, respond
Don't react, respond
Don't react, respond
When you get what you don't want
Don't react, respond



Hahahahahahaha
