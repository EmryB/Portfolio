The cast was made to reset broken bones
But there's no such thing to fix a love gone wrong
Keep knocking the door 'cause I know someone's there
I wait on the porch hoping someday I'll be let in
They say in the end everything will be okay
If it's not okay, well then, it ain't the end


Had dreams to you I would belong
Had the dream you would stay with me 'til a-kingdom come
Turns out forever has come and gone
Am I the only one hanging on?


Hand in hand, yeah, we took it on
You answered my prayers, now from my knees, I can't get up
Lost patience with time, yeah, hurry up your patience tonight
I'd like some of yours, in trade can take all of mine


I dreamt to you I would belong
Had the dream you would stay with me 'til your kingdom come
Turns out it was more like hit-and-run
Am I the only one hanging on?
Oh, am I the only one hanging on? (Yeah)



If you could see, oh, what I see now
You'd find a way to stay somehow
Oh, if you could see, yeah, what I see now
You'd make your way to stay somehow


May your days be long 'til kingdom come
May our days be long before kingdom come
May our days be long until kingdom come
We can become one last setting sun
Am I the only one hanging on?
We could become one last setting sun
Or be the sun at the break of dawn
Let us not fade
Let us not fade
