Oh, did I say something wrong?
Oh, did I walk out of step?
To you, do I still belong?
Do I have to be scared?
Oh, I'm not saying I know, it's all feeling unclear
We all like control, I surrender to you, dear


You're hurting yourself, it's plain to see
I think you're hurting yourself just to hurt me
We used to laugh, we used to sing
We used to dance, we had our own scene
You're hurting yourself, it's plain to see
I think you're hurting yourself just to hurt me
We used to laugh, we used to sing
We used to dance, we used to believe


There's something I should've known?
Was I acting too proud?
Oh, in my weakness, did I somehow get too loud?
Oh, can I get you alone?
Oh, let me fall at your feet
Why must I be compelled to admit defeat?



You're hurting yourself, it's plain to see
I think you're hurting yourself just to hurt me
We used to laugh, we used to sing
We used to dance, we were our own scene
Hurting yourself, nothing to tell
Your secret is well and safe with me
We used to laugh, we used to sing
We used to crash, we used to believe




I hear the voices calling, hear the voices calling
All around my head, all around my head
Hear the voices calling, oh, again they're calling
All around my head, have I lost my friend?
Is this what we've become? One last setting sun
I'll give but I can't give up, I'll live not long enough
To stop these voices calling, stop the voices calling
All around my head, as if you never left


You're hurting yourself, it's plain to see
I think you're hurting yourself just to hurt me
We used to laugh, we used to sing
We used to dance, we had our own scene
Hurting yourself, it's plain to see
I think you're hurting yourself 'cause you hurt me
We used to laugh, we used to drink
We used to dance, we used to believe



Oh-oh, whoa
Yeah
