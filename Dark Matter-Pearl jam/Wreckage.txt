Visited by thought, another darkened day
How you are like the sun hidin' somewhere beyond the rain
I'm needin' for the light, stormy is the grey
Rivers overflowin', drownin' all our yesterdays


Visited by thoughts on another darkened week
How even every winner hits a losin' streak
The mistakes we all make and perfectly repeat
Chains are made by DNA refusin', refusin' to release


Combin' through the wreckage, pourin' through the sand
Surrounded by the remnants, what we could and couldn't have
Rakin' through the ashes fallin' through my hands
Charcoal on the faces in the burned-up photographs


Oh, visited by thoughts and, on this I got to say
If you're feelin' the leavin', I can't make you stay
I've only ever wanted for it not to be this way
But you're now like the water and the water will find its way


Combin' through the wreckage
Holdin' out, holdin' on
Combin' through the wreckage
Combin' through the wreckage



Oh, visited by thoughts and not just in the night
That I no longer give a fuck who is wrong and who's right
This game of winner takes all and all means nothing left
Spoils go the victor and the other left for dead


Uh-huh, combin' through the wreckage
Holdin' out, holdin' on
Combin' through the wreckage


Combin' through the wreckage
Holdin' out, holding on, holdin' out
Holdin' you, holdin' on


(Combin' through the wreckage) Combin' through the wreckage
(Fallin' through the wreckage) Fallin' through the wreckage
(Crawlin' through the wreckage) Holdin' out
(Combin' through the wreckage) Holdin' on
(Combin' through the wreckage) Oh
(Fallin' through the wreckage) Fallin' through the wreckage
(Crawlin' through the wreckage) Crawlin' through the wreckage
(Combin' through the wreckage) Combin' through the wreckage
(Combin' through the wreckage) Combin' through the wreckage
(Combin' through the wreckage)
